# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the process of requirement analysis in software development. It highlights the importance of gathering, analyzing, and managing requirements to ensure that software projects align with user needs and business goals.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring that the final product meets the needs of users and aligns with business objectives.

During this phase, stakeholders—including clients, end-users, and developers—collaborate to clarify expectations and document requirements in a precise and structured way. This reduces ambiguity, prevents scope creep, and minimizes costly rework later in the project.

### Importance in SDLC:

- **Clarity of Objectives:** Ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of what the software must achieve.
- **Better Planning:** Provides a clear roadmap for design, development, and testing.
- **Cost and Time Efficiency:** Detects potential issues early, reducing expensive changes during later stages.
- **Quality Assurance:** Sets measurable criteria to validate whether the final product meets user expectations.
- **Risk Reduction:** Identifies challenges and constraints upfront, helping in risk management.
